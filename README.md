## Honesto

Given the timeframe I felt all of the functional pages were doable - Login, Landing Page, Give Feedback, My Feedback, Team Feedback, and 404 page. I left out the "loading" pages/functionality for all
of the pages as they were not crucial to functionality. Parts of the application are just for show, i.e. alert badges in the header and question "star" rating system. I didn't include any tooltips
as again, they weren't crucial to a minimum viable product.

Given a week to do this, I would implement Redux to manage more global state, like notifications of new feedback, as well as add unit tests. I would also be able to add
in functionality to "for show" components, like the question star rating system or tooltips.
